# ContestTrade: A Multi-Agent Trading System Based on Internal Contest Mechanism

**ContestTrade** is an innovative multi-agent (Multi-Agent) trading framework. With ContestTrade you can easily build a dedicated AI trading team: just set the analysis time, and it will autonomously scan the whole market without human intervention, mine potential event-driven investment opportunities from massive data, and, through an internal selection mechanism, construct the most trustworthy investment portfolio for you.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a multi-agent trading framework focused on event-driven stock selection. The system's goal is to automatically discover, evaluate, and track event-driven opportunities with investment value without human intervention, and finally output executable asset allocation recommendations.

**Core features:**
- **Automatic stock selection**: whole-market scanning and signal generation that automatically outputs tradable candidate stock lists without manual screening.
- **Event-driven**: triggered by catalysts such as news, announcements, capital flows, and policy; focuses on opportunities with significant information impact.
- **Personalized configuration**: supports user-defined agent research preferences and strategies to flexibly adapt to different investment styles.

> Note: This framework currently only supports the **Chinese A-share** market.


## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

The workflow of ContestTrade operates through a structured two-stage pipeline, simulating the dynamic decision-making process of an investment firm. This dual-contest framework ensures that final decisions are driven only by the most robust and effective insights, maintaining strong adaptability and resilience in complex markets.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** First, raw market data from multiple sources is fed into the **Data Team**. Multiple Data Analysis Agents work in parallel to refine this raw data into structured "textual factors." At this stage, the internal contest mechanism evaluates the potential value of the factors generated by each data agent and constructs an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** This optimal factor portfolio is then passed to the **Research Team**. Multiple Research Agents, each with their unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to a powerful set of financial tools, conduct parallel, in-depth analyses of these factors and submit their respective trading proposals. A second round of internal contests then evaluates these proposals, ultimately synthesizing a unified and reliable asset allocation strategy as the final output.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Before running ContestTrade, you need to configure the necessary API keys and LLM parameters.

Edit the `config.yaml` file and enter your API keys. The table below lists all required and optional keys:

| Key                      | Description                                | Required |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `TUSHARE_KEY`            | Tushare data interface key                 | **Yes** |
| `BOCHA_KEY`              | Bocha search engine key                    | No       |
| `SERP_KEY`               | SerpAPI search engine key                  | No       |
| `LLM_API_KEY`            | LLM API key for general tasks              | **Yes** |
| `LLM_BASE_URL`           | LLM API base URL for general tasks         | **Yes** |
| `LLM_THINKING_API_KEY`   | LLM API key for complex reasoning          | No       |
| `LLM_THINKING_BASE_URL`  | LLM API base URL for complex reasoning     | No       |
| `VLM_API_KEY`            | VLM API key for visual analysis            | No       |
| `VLM_BASE_URL`           | VLM API base URL for visual analysis       | No       |

> Note：LLM API and VLM API require you to apply for them yourself. Specifically, you need to fill in the URL, API Key, and model name based on the platform and model you are using. If you do not have a Tushare API key, it is currently also supported to configure the LLM API in `contest_trade/config/config.akshare.yaml`.

## Preference

Each Research Agent corresponds to a "trading belief". The system will generate investment signals based on these beliefs combined with data and tools (each belief outputs up to 5 signals). The configuration file is located at `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`, and its format is a JSON array of strings.

Example 1 — preference for short-term event-driven (more aggressive):
```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

Example 2 — preference for stable events (more conservative):
```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

Default configuration:
```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 — risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 — conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 — aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 — defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```

## Usage
