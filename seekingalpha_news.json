        "content": "JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) agreed to pay Malaysia 1.4B ringgit ($330M) to settle all claims relating to 1MDB, the sovereign wealth fund that was the focus of one of the world's largest financial frauds, the government of Malaysia said Friday. The settlement will end the U.S. lender's exposure to the scandal that came to light in 2015. In 2020, Goldman Sachs (GS) reached a $3.9B settlement with Malaysia to resolve claims that it misled investors in bond sales that raised $6.5B for the fund. The U.S. Department of Justice has determined that $4.5B was misappropriated from 1MDB. Also on Friday, Switzerland's Attorney General fined the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CHF 3M ($3.7M) for \"failing to take all reasonable and necessary organizational measures\" to prevent money laundering of the funds misappropriated from 1MDB. In 2021, 1MDB sued units of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Deutsche Bank (DB), and Coutts & Co., alleging \"negligence, breach of contract, conspiracy to defraud/injure, and/or dishonest assistance,\" and sought to recover alleged losses. Under the Malaysian agreement, JPMorgan (JPM) will, \"without admission of liability,\" pay the amount to Malaysia's Assets Recovery Trust Account. A JPMorgan spokesman commented, \"We appreciate the collaboration with the Malaysian Government in resolving past matters related to 1MDB, which have been thoroughly reviewed. Since then, we\u2019ve enhanced our controls, earning the trust of regulators in Switzerland and beyond. We are pleased to have these matters resolved and remain focused on delivering exceptional service to our clients.\" Billions of dollars were funneled out of 1MDB starting in 2009, until the scandal was reported in 2015.

        "content": "Nisian Hughes/DigitalVision via Getty ImagesBally's Corporation (NYSE:BALY) updated investors on the progress on its previously disclosed transaction agreement with Intralot S.A. (OTCPK:IRLTF) (OTC:IRLTY). Under the terms of the deal, Intralot (OTCPK:IRLTF) (OTC:IRLTY) is set to acquire all issued and outstanding capital stock of Bally's (NYSE:BALY) Holdings Limited. That subsidiary holds Bally's (BALY) international interactive business. The expected closing of the transaction in Q4 will result in Bally\u2019s (BALY) becoming the majority shareholder of Intralot. The deal is structured so that while Intralot takes direct ownership of the international interactive assets, control of the combined global entity shifts to Bally's (BALY), meaning it will have influence over Intralot's broader operations. On August 14, Bally's (BALY) received notifications from the Gambling Commission of Great Britain confirming that, contingent on routine ongoing requirements, its UK licenses (held by Gamesys Limited, Bally\u2019s (Newcastle) Limited, and Gamesys Operations Limited) will remain in effect after the transaction closes. The regulatory approval addresses a critical hurdle and clears a path for finalizing the transaction. The deal with Intralot (OTCPK:IRLTF) (OTC:IRLTY) is seen by analysts as transformative for Bally's (BALY) which has been repositioning itself as a global digital gaming and interactive entertainment player. By integrating with Intralot\u2019s established international operations and technology, Bally\u2019s (BALY) expects to broaden its global reach and strengthen its digital platform, especially in regulated European and emerging markets. Intralot (OTCPK:IRLTF) (OTC:IRLTY) is a Greek-based, publicly listed global gaming technology company that provides gambling systems, sports betting management, interactive gaming services, and omnichannel lottery solutions to state-licensed operators in over 39 countries. The company is best known for lottery modernization, digital transformation, and responsible gaming. Shares of Bally's (BALY) were down 1.6% in premarket trading on Friday.

        "content": "Gary YeowellInvestors today are looking to Wyoming, and it's not to book a national park getaway before the summer comes to an end. The annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium hosted by the Kansas City Fed is underway, with Chairman Jerome Powell set to take the stage at 10:00 AM ET. The theme of the 2025 conference is titled \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy,\" which will come at a time when labor market indicators are being challenged and questions swirl over real-time economic data. Snapshot: The recent massive revision to nonfarm payroll numbers not only made waves after President Trump ousted the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but also sent policymakers scrambling to make sense of the new numbers. The 258K jobs that were previously thought to have been added in May and June were actually non-existent, meaning the U.S. only added 19,000 and 14,000 jobs for those two months, respectively. Another weak NFP gain of 73K was later recorded in July, indicating a broad slowdown in job growth for the overall labor market. Typically, that would have seriously worried many Fed officials (and some are), but others are still debating root causes to determine the path forward for monetary policy. If the underlying reasons are linked to Trump's immigration policies and baby boomer retirement, it might not warrant a strong shift in monetary policy since the downturn is based on labor supply. However, if hiring fundamentals are no longer intact, it could require a bigger dose of monetary stimulus, though that could also be complicated by signs of inflation heating up in the latest CPI and PPI prints. The big show: Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to share some of his thoughts on the matter this morning and what it might mean for the interest rate outlook and long-term policy goals. Wild trading can ensue following the closely watched event, like the notable Jackson Hole hangover of 2022, which saw all three of the major averages slump between 3%-4% after Powell shot down any hopes that the Fed would telegraph a pivot on its aggressive policy tightening. \"Equity markets, for its part, are entering this [year's] symposium near their highs, and stocks are largely priced for further confirmation of an easing in rates in September,\" SA Analyst Justin Purohit noted. \"That does leave investors vulnerable if Powell's speech underwhelms and delivers unexpected surprises.\" More on markets Fed's Next Move Should Be A Hike, And Not A Cut Walmart Earnings And Jackson Hole: Even The Wealthy Want 'Great Value' Bubble?

Here are some of Friday's biggest stock movers: Biggest stock gainers Zoom Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) +6% - Shares rose after delivering strong Q2 results and raising its full-year outlook. The company guided Q3 revenue to $1.21B\u2013$1.22B (midpoint $1.215B vs. $1.21B est.) and EPS to $1.42\u2013$1.44 (vs. $1.39 est.), while FY revenue was lifted to $4.83B\u2013$4.84B (vs. prior $4.8B\u2013$4.81B, $4.81B est.) and EPS to $5.81\u2013$5.84 (vs. prior $5.56\u2013$5.59, $5.60 est.). CEO Eric Yuan credited AI-driven innovation and efficiency gains, highlighting Zoom\u2019s highest revenue growth in 11 quarters, a 9-pt GAAP operating margin expansion, and stronger free cash flow guidance of $1.74B\u2013$1.78B. NIO (NYSE:NIO) +5% - Shares surged after the company unveiled one of its most affordable vehicles yet, highlighting the intensifying price war in the domestic market. The new ES8 is offered in six- and seven-seat Executive Premium and Executive Signature Editions with starting prices of RMB 416,800 (RMB 308,800 with BaaS) and RMB 456,800 (RMB 348,800 with BaaS). The base ES8 is priced below the Tesla (TSLA) Model Y L six-seat SUV, and in Europe the model will be marketed as the EL8 due to a trademark dispute with Audi. Biggest stock losers Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) -5% - Shares slipped after issuing slower growth guidance for Q1 and FY2026, overshadowing better-than-expected Q4 results. The QuickBooks and Credit Karma parent sees FY2026 revenue of $21.0B-$21.2B, up 12%-13% from last year, roughly in line with consensus, and projects non-GAAP EPS of $22.98-$23.18 vs. $22.99 expected. By segment, Global Business Solutions revenue is forecast to rise 14%-15% from 16% in FY2025, Consumer Group up 8%-9% vs. 10%, and Credit Karma up 10%-13% vs. 32%. For fiscal Q1, Intuit guided EPS of $3.05-$3.12, bracketing the $3.07 consensus, on revenue growth of 14%-15% compared with 20% in Q4. Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) -4% - Shares dropped after reporting fiscal Q2 results and guidance that exceeded expectations but failed to spark enthusiasm. For Q3, the company guided subscription revenue of $2.24B, in line with estimates, while FY2026 subscription revenue is projected at $8.82B, slightly above Wall Street\u2019s $8.8B forecast. Workday also raised its adjusted operating margin outlook to 29% from 28%, topping both its prior view and the 28.5% consensus. Alongside results, the company announced an agreement to acquire Paradox, an AI-powered candidate experience platform.

The company invited firms including Carlyle (CG), EQT (OTCPK:EQBBF), Hillhouse Investment and Primavera Capital to attend management presentations detailing financial and operational details of its China business, the sources said, adding that Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), KKR (KKR), and Bain Capital make up other potential bidders. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) reportedly began a formal sale process for its China unit in May, asking potential buyers to submit responses to a questionnaire. The company said at the time that it was not pursuing a full sale. In July, Starbucks shortlisted up to 10 bidders and signed NDAs before granting access to financial and operational data, sources said. The stake sale, expected to value the unit at up to $10 billion, aims to revive a business hit by slowing growth and rising competition from local rivals like Luckin Coffee (OTCPK:LKNCY). The coffee chain\u2019s China market share fell to 14% last year from 34% in 2019, according to data from market researcher Euromonitor International. Starbucks (SBUX) has been in informal talks with potential buyers since late last year and is targeting a deal by year-end, sources previously told Reuters. CEO Brian Niccol said on last month\u2019s earnings call that Starbucks has drawn interest from over 20 parties and is reviewing options. \"We remain committed to our China business and want to retain a meaningful stake...
